Description: Provides two methods for automatic calculation of gene scores from gene count tables: the z-score method, which requires a table of samples being scored and a count table with control samples, and the geometric mean method, which does not rely on control samples. The mathematical methods implemented are described by Kim et al. (2018) <doi:10.1089/jir.2017.0127>.
